WELCOME TO JUGGLER - The premire project management web app.

Juggler is a very simple project management app that allows you to create your own user profile, add projects, and create tasks for those individual projects.

- You can mark projects as "Active" or "Inactive" so that you can focus on high priority goals first. 

- Set a time allocation for each task of a project so that you can effectively manage your time.

Thank you for using Juggler, and I hope it makes achieving your goals a bit more managable.
